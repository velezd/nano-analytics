# Nano Analytics

Simple self-hosted web visitors counter.

- It tries to count how many unique users accessed different pages on a website,
  without looking at or storing any personal information.
- Only one random UUID cookie is used.
- One user using multiple web browsers or devices cannot be tracked and will be
  counted as multiple users.
- The cookie expires after 30 days and next access will be counted as new
  user.
- The counter has no way to prevent fake entries to be added by bad actors,
  but should be otherwise secure.
- Access to the statistics is not restricted.

## Setup
Requirements: webserver with PHP and MariaDB/MySQL.

1. Change DB settings in nano-analytics.php and save it to root of your website.
2. Create database using setup.sql
3. Include nano-analytics.js in all pages where you want to collect statistics.

## Legal
Disclaimer: I'm not a legal expert, this is just my opinion, I'm not liable for
any claim, damages or other liability.

Since the counter doesn't collect any personal information and uses only one
random cookie that is required for it to function, consent from users should not
be needed and this use should fit into legitimate interests lawful basis.
In that case all you need is to inform the user. Here is an example text:
